Welcome to QuickCW's documentation!
===================================

QuickCW is an analysis software dedicated to search for and characterize gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries (or continuous waves, CWs) in pulsar timing array data. It utilizes techniques from [arXiv:2204.07160](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07160) and `numba` just-in-time compilation to make the code fast.
